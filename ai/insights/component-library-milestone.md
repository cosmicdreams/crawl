# Milestone: Component Library & Styleguide

## Overview
Create a comprehensive component library and styleguide that showcases the design tokens extracted by the crawler. This will provide a visual reference for designers and developers to understand the design system and how to use the tokens in their projects.

## Goals
- Create a visual representation of all extracted design tokens
- Provide interactive examples of how to use the tokens
- Generate documentation for the design system
- Enable easy sharing of the design system with stakeholders

## Features

### 1. Token Visualization (Priority: High)
- **Color Palette**: Visual display of all color tokens with names, values, and usage examples
- **Typography Scale**: Showcase all typography tokens with font families, sizes, weights, and line heights
- **Spacing System**: Visual representation of spacing tokens with measurements and examples
- **Border & Radius**: Display of border styles, widths, and radius values
- **Animation & Transitions**: Interactive examples of animation tokens

### 2. Component Showcase (Priority: High)
- **Component Browser**: Searchable gallery of extracted UI components
- **Component Details**: Detailed view of each component with:
  - Visual preview
  - HTML structure
  - CSS styles
  - Associated tokens
  - Usage guidelines
- **Responsive Preview**: Ability to view components at different screen sizes

### 3. Interactive Playground (Priority: Medium)
- **Token Editor**: Interface to modify token values and see real-time updates
- **Component Customizer**: Tool to customize components using available tokens
- **Code Generator**: Generate code snippets for using tokens and components

### 4. Documentation Generator (Priority: Medium)
- **Markdown Export**: Generate markdown documentation for the design system
- **PDF Export**: Create shareable PDF documentation
- **Design System Guidelines**: Auto-generate usage guidelines based on token analysis

### 5. Integration Features (Priority: Low)
- **Figma Plugin**: Export the component library to Figma
- **Storybook Integration**: Generate Storybook stories for components
- **CSS Framework Export**: Generate a custom CSS framework based on the tokens

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Visualization (Weeks 1-2)
- Create the basic structure for the styleguide UI
- Implement token visualization for colors, typography, spacing, and borders
- Develop the component browser with basic filtering

### Phase 2: Component Details & Playground (Weeks 3-4)
- Enhance component browser with detailed views
- Implement the interactive playground for tokens
- Add responsive preview functionality

### Phase 3: Documentation & Export (Weeks 5-6)
- Develop documentation generator
- Implement export functionality for different formats
- Create usage guidelines generator

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Weeks 7-8)
- Implement integration features
- Refine UI and user experience
- Add advanced filtering and search capabilities

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- Use React for the UI components
- Implement a state management solution for the playground
- Create a modular system for token visualization

### Performance
- Optimize rendering of large token sets
- Implement virtualization for component lists
- Use code splitting to reduce initial load time

### Accessibility
- Ensure all visualizations have proper contrast
- Provide text alternatives for visual elements
- Make the interface keyboard navigable

## Success Metrics
- All token types are visually represented
- Components are displayed with accurate styles
- Documentation is comprehensive and exportable
- Users can easily understand and use the design system

## Future Enhancements
- Version comparison of design systems
- AI-powered design system analysis and recommendations
- Team collaboration features
- Custom theme builder
