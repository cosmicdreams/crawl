# Design Token Crawler v3: Team Challenge Edition

## Vision

We are a team of three developers, each with a passion for building robust, modern, and visually intuitive developer tools. Our challenge: design and implement the ultimate design token crawler and pipeline for the modern web, with seamless Drupal integration and a UI inspired by the best of ETL and dataflow tools.

## Core Principles
- **Type Safety & Modern Tooling**: TypeScript everywhere, strict and expressive types.
- **Test-Driven**: Vitest and Playwright for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Visual Dataflow**: ReactFlow for pipeline editing, inspired by Flowise, Airflow, and classic ETL tools.
- **API-First**: All core logic is accessible via a clean API, usable from CLI or UI.
- **Drupal-First Insights**: Deep integration with Drupal via a custom module for real-time site analysis.

## System Overview

### 1. Data Pipeline Engine
- Modular ETL pipeline: crawl, extract, transform, generate, and sync.
- Each stage is a TypeScript class implementing a common interface.
- Pipelines are visualized and edited in the UI, and can be executed via API or CLI.

### 2. Visual UI
- Built with React and ReactFlow.
- Drag-and-drop pipeline editor: connect stages, configure nodes, visualize data flow.
- UI design inspired by Flowise, Airflow, and Microsoft DTSâ€”clear, node-based, and interactive.
- Sidebar for configuration, logs, and real-time status.
- Browser component for previewing crawled pages, extracted tokens, and generated assets.

### 3. API Layer
- RESTful API for pipeline orchestration, status, and results.
- Can be driven by the graphical UI or a CLI tool.
- All pipeline stages, configs, and results are accessible via API endpoints.

### 4. Drupal Integration
- Custom Drupal module exposes endpoints for design tokens, content types, blocks, and more.
- Pipeline can pull from and push to Drupal, supporting two-way sync.
- Authentication and caching for efficient, secure access.
- Enables deep insights into Drupal site structure and theming.

## Key Features

- **Pipeline as Code & UI**: Define, edit, and run pipelines visually or via config files.
- **Composable Stages**: Crawler, extractors (color, typography, spacing, etc.), transformers, token generators, Drupal sync.
- **Live Visualization**: See pipeline execution, data flow, and results in real time.
- **Extensible**: Add new extractors, transformers, or output formats with minimal boilerplate.
- **Testing Built-In**: Every stage and integration point is covered by Vitest and Playwright.
- **Drupal Smart**: Out-of-the-box support for analyzing and synchronizing with Drupal sites.

## Example Pipeline

1. **Crawl**: Start from a base URL, discover and fetch pages.  And If Drupal is found, use crawl_helper module to pull key insights from the Drupal site.
2. **Extract**: Run extractors for colors, typography, spacing, etc.
3. **Synthesize**: With the raw data found, transform info into design tokens, so that we can..
4. **Generate**: Output tokens as CSS, JSON, Figma, or Drupal theme assets.  Build a styleguide and component library. 

All stages are visualized as nodes in the ReactFlow UI, with connections representing data flow.

## Developer Experience

- **TypeScript-first**: All code, configs, and APIs are strongly typed.
- **Hot Reloading**: UI and backend reload instantly on change.
- **Storybook/Playwright**: Visual and behavioral tests for every component and pipeline stage.
- **CLI & UI Parity**: Anything you can do in the UI, you can do from the command line.

---

## Testing Strategy
- **Vitest**: Unit and integration tests for all pipeline stages and utilities.
- **Playwright**: End-to-end tests for the UI and API.
- **Fixtures**: Realistic Drupal sites and static HTML for robust extractor tests.

---

## Technologies
- **TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety.
- **React + ReactFlow**: Visual, node-based UI.
- **Vitest & Playwright**: Modern, fast testing.
- **Express**: API server for orchestration.
- **Custom Drupal Module**: Deep site insights and two-way sync.

---

## Why This Approach?
- **Visual pipelines** make complex ETL and design token workflows accessible and debuggable.
- **API-first** means automation, scripting, and integration are easy.
- **Drupal integration** unlocks real-world value for teams using Drupal as a design system consumer.
- **Testing-first** ensures reliability and confidence as the system evolves.

---

## Next Steps
- Define pipeline stage interfaces and core types in TypeScript.
- Build the ReactFlow-based pipeline editor and connect it to the API.
- Implement the custom Drupal module and test against real sites.
- Write comprehensive tests for every stage and integration.
- Iterate, challenge each other, and build the best design token crawler on the market!
