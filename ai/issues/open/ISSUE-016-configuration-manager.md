# Create Centralized Configuration Manager

## Description
Currently, each extractor has its own configuration management, leading to duplication and inconsistency. We need to create a centralized configuration manager that will handle all configuration needs across the application.

## Impact
- Reduces code duplication
- Ensures consistent configuration handling
- Makes it easier to maintain and update configurations
- Improves error handling for configuration issues
- Makes the application more maintainable

## Reproduction Steps
1. Look at any extractor file (e.g., `extract-colors.js`, `extract-typography.js`)
2. Notice the duplicate configuration handling
3. Observe the lack of validation and environment-specific configurations

## Expected Behavior
- Single source of truth for configuration
- Environment-specific configurations
- Configuration validation
- Easy access to configuration from any part of the application
- Clear documentation of configuration options

## Actual Behavior
- Each extractor manages its own configuration
- No validation of configuration values
- No environment-specific configurations
- Duplicate code across extractors
- Inconsistent configuration handling

## Suggested Solution
1. Create `src/config` directory
2. Implement `config-manager.js` with:
   - Base configuration schema
   - Environment-specific overrides
   - Validation rules
   - Default values
3. Add configuration types for each extractor
4. Implement configuration merging strategy
5. Update all extractors to use the new configuration manager
