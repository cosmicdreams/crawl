# Implement Basic Styling and Progress Indicators for Console UI

## Description
The current console UI uses plain text output with minimal formatting, making it difficult to distinguish between different types of information. There are no progress indicators for long-running operations, which leaves users uncertain about the application's status. Adding basic styling and progress indicators would significantly improve the user experience.

## Impact
- Difficult to distinguish between different types of information (headers, success/error messages, data)
- No visual feedback during long-running operations
- Lack of visual hierarchy makes output harder to scan
- Plain text output appears outdated and unprofessional

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run the application with `node run.js`
2. Observe the plain text output with no styling
3. Note the lack of progress indicators during crawling and extraction

## Expected Behavior
The console output should:
1. Use colors and styling to create visual hierarchy
2. Display spinners during long-running operations
3. Show progress bars when processing multiple items
4. Use visual indicators for success/error states

## Actual Behavior
The console output is plain text with no styling or progress indicators, making it difficult to scan and understand the application's status.

## Screenshots/Evidence
N/A

## Suggested Solution
Implement basic styling and progress indicators:

1. Add required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install chalk ora cli-progress --save
   ```

2. Implement color coding for different types of information:
   ```javascript
   const chalk = require('chalk');
   
   // Headers
   console.log(chalk.bold.blue('\n=== Step 1: Crawling the site ==='));
   
   // Success messages
   console.log(chalk.green('✓ Crawl completed successfully!'));
   
   // Warnings
   console.log(chalk.yellow('⚠ Warning: Some pages could not be accessed'));
   
   // Errors
   console.log(chalk.red('✗ Error: Failed to extract colors from page'));
   
   // Important data
   console.log(`Found ${chalk.cyan('42')} unique color values`);
   ```

3. Add spinners for long-running operations:
   ```javascript
   const ora = require('ora');
   
   const spinner = ora('Crawling website...').start();
   // ... perform crawl ...
   spinner.succeed('Crawl completed successfully!');
   ```

4. Implement progress bars for multi-step operations:
   ```javascript
   const { createBar } = require('cli-progress');
   
   const bar = createBar({
     format: 'Analyzing pages |{bar}| {percentage}% | {value}/{total} pages',
     barCompleteChar: '█',
     barIncompleteChar: '░'
   });
   
   bar.start(totalPages, 0);
   for (let i = 0; i < totalPages; i++) {
     // Process page
     bar.update(i + 1);
   }
   bar.stop();
   ```

5. Update the main run.js script to use these styling and progress indicators for:
   - Website crawling
   - Page analysis
   - Token generation
