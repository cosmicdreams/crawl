# Fix Site Crawler Type Safety

## Description
The site-crawler.js file has several type safety issues that need to be addressed:
1. URL handling without proper null checks
2. Type assertions being used in JavaScript files
3. Potential undefined values in object properties
4. Incorrect arithmetic operations with Date objects

## Impact
These issues could lead to runtime errors and unexpected behavior when:
- Processing URLs
- Calculating durations
- Handling undefined values
- Working with date objects

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run the application with a site to crawl
2. Monitor for any type-related errors in the console

## Expected Behavior
The crawler should handle all edge cases gracefully without type-related errors.

## Actual Behavior
The crawler may throw errors or behave unexpectedly due to type safety issues.

## Screenshots/Evidence
Example errors:
```
Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'
The left-hand side of an arithmetic operation must be of type 'any', 'number', 'bigint' or an enum type
```

## Suggested Solution
1. Add proper null checks for URL handling
2. Replace TypeScript type assertions with JSDoc comments
3. Add proper type checking for object properties
4. Fix date arithmetic operations to use proper methods
