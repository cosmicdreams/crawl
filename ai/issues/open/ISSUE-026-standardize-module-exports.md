# Standardize Module Exports

## Description
The codebase has inconsistent module export patterns:
1. Some files use default exports
2. Some files use named exports
3. Some files mix both approaches
4. Some files have duplicate exports

This inconsistency makes it harder to maintain and understand the codebase.

## Impact
- Inconsistent import patterns across the codebase
- Potential confusion about which export style to use
- Difficulty in maintaining consistent module interfaces
- Possible issues with tree-shaking and bundling

## Reproduction Steps
1. Review the export patterns in various files
2. Note the inconsistencies in how modules are exported and imported

## Expected Behavior
All modules should follow a consistent export pattern:
- Either use default exports or named exports, but not both
- Be consistent across similar types of modules
- Have clear documentation about the export pattern used

## Actual Behavior
Inconsistent export patterns across the codebase.

## Screenshots/Evidence
Example inconsistencies:
```javascript
// Some files use default exports
export default class UIUtils { ... }

// Some files use named exports
export function initTelemetry() { ... }

// Some files mix both
export function someFunction() { ... }
export default { someFunction };
```

## Suggested Solution
1. Choose a consistent export pattern (preferably named exports)
2. Update all files to use the chosen pattern
3. Add documentation about the chosen pattern
4. Update imports to match the new export pattern
