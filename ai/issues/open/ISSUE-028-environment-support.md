# Add Environment Support

## Description
Currently, the application doesn't support different configurations for different environments (development, production, test). We need to add environment-specific configuration support to make the application more flexible and easier to manage across different environments.

## Impact
- Enables different configurations for different environments
- Makes it easier to manage development and production settings
- Improves security by separating sensitive configuration
- Makes testing easier with test-specific configurations
- Reduces configuration errors when deploying

## Reproduction Steps
1. Look at the current configuration files
2. Notice there's no way to specify different configurations for different environments
3. Try to run the application in different environments
4. Observe that the same configuration is used everywhere

## Expected Behavior
- Different configurations for different environments
- Easy switching between environments
- Environment-specific overrides
- Clear documentation of environment differences
- Secure handling of sensitive configuration

## Actual Behavior
- Single configuration for all environments
- No way to specify environment-specific settings
- Sensitive configuration mixed with general configuration
- No clear separation between environments
- Manual configuration changes needed for different environments

## Suggested Solution
1. Create environment-specific config files:
   - `config/default.js`
   - `config/development.js`
   - `config/production.js`
   - `config/test.js`
2. Implement environment detection
3. Add environment variable support
4. Document environment configuration
5. Add environment-specific validation rules
