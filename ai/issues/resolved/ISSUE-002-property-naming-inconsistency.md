# Inconsistent Property Naming in Color Extractor

## Description
The color extractor module used inconsistent property naming. The results object had a property named `colorStyles`, but the function that extracts colors from a page returned an object with a property named `elementStyles`. This inconsistency made it difficult to understand and use the API.

## Impact
- Confusing API
- Potential for bugs when accessing properties
- Difficult to maintain and extend the code

## Reproduction Steps
1. Look at the results object in the `extractColorsFromCrawledPages` function
2. Observe that it uses `colorStyles` to store element styles
3. Look at the code that processes the results of the `extractColors` function
4. Observe that it accesses `elementStyles` from the returned object

## Expected Behavior
The property naming should be consistent throughout the codebase, using either `colorStyles` or `elementStyles` consistently.

## Actual Behavior
The code used `colorStyles` in some places and `elementStyles` in others, leading to confusion and potential bugs.

## Suggested Solution
Standardize on one property name (preferably `elementStyles` for clarity) and update all references to use this name consistently.

## Related Issues
- None

## History
- 2023-07-10: Issue created
- 2023-07-10: Fixed by renaming `colorStyles` to `elementStyles` throughout the codebase
