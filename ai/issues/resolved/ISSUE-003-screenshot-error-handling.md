# Inadequate Error Handling for Screenshot Generation

## Description
The color extractor module attempted to generate color swatches using `page.screenshot()` without proper error handling. This caused the extraction process to fail when running in a test environment or any context where screenshot functionality is not available.

## Impact
- Tests fail when trying to extract colors
- The extraction process is not robust against different environments
- Potential for unhandled exceptions in production

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run the color extractor in a test environment
2. Observe that it fails with an error: "page.screenshot is not a function"

## Expected Behavior
The color extractor should check if screenshot functionality is available before attempting to use it, and gracefully handle cases where it's not available.

## Actual Behavior
The code assumed that `page.screenshot` would always be available, causing errors when it wasn't.

## Suggested Solution
Add checks to verify if `page.setContent` and `page.screenshot` functions exist before attempting to use them, and wrap the screenshot generation in a try-catch block to handle any errors.
