# Multiple Linting Errors Throughout Codebase

## Description
After adding ESLint to the project, we discovered 53 linting errors across multiple files. These errors include:

1. Browser globals used in Node.js context (document, window, CSSRule, NodeFilter)
2. Use of process.exit() instead of throwing errors
3. Use of features not supported in the configured Node.js version (URL, Object.fromEntries)
4. Undefined variables (DEFAULT_CONFIG)
5. Conditional assignment issues (no-cond-assign)
6. Character class issues (no-misleading-character-class)

## Impact
- Code quality issues that could lead to bugs
- Potential compatibility issues with different Node.js versions
- Inconsistent coding style across the codebase

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run ESLint on the codebase: `npx eslint src --format stylish`
2. Observe the 53 errors reported

## Expected Behavior
The codebase should follow consistent coding standards and not contain linting errors.

## Actual Behavior
The codebase contains 53 linting errors across multiple files.

## Suggested Solution
1. Fix the most critical errors first:
   - Define browser globals in the ESLint configuration for files that need them
   - Replace process.exit() with proper error handling
   - Fix undefined variables like DEFAULT_CONFIG

2. Create a plan to address the remaining issues:
   - Update the Node.js version requirement if needed
   - Fix conditional assignment issues
   - Address character class issues

3. Consider implementing a pre-commit hook to prevent new linting errors from being introduced.
