# Create tests for extract-spacing.js

## Description
We need to implement unit tests for the spacing extractor to verify it correctly extracts margin, padding, and gap values from web pages. This will help ensure the extractor works correctly and make it easier to refactor the code in the future.

## Impact
Without proper tests, we can't be confident that the spacing extractor is working correctly. Adding tests will:
- Help identify bugs in the current implementation
- Make it safer to refactor the code
- Provide documentation for how the extractor should work

## Reproduction Steps
1. Create a new test file at `tests/extractors/extract-spacing.test.js`
2. Implement tests for the main extraction function and helper functions
3. Run the tests with `npm test`

## Expected Behavior
All tests should pass, verifying that the spacing extractor:
- Correctly extracts spacing values from pages
- Properly handles different units (px, rem, em, %)
- Gracefully handles errors
- Generates the expected output format

## Actual Behavior
Currently, there are no tests for the spacing extractor.

## Screenshots/Evidence
N/A

## Suggested Solution
Create a test file following the pattern of existing extractor tests. The test file should:

1. Mock dependencies (fs, playwright)
2. Test the main `extractSpacingFromCrawledPages` function
3. Test the `extractSpacing` function
4. Test error handling

Additionally, the extractor could be refactored to make it more testable:
- Extract the page evaluation logic into a separate function that can be tested independently
- Make the config object injectable for testing
- Add an `extractSpacingFromPage` function similar to other extractors
