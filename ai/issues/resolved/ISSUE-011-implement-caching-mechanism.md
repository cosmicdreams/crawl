# Implement Caching Mechanism for Extractors

## Description
Extraction can be time-consuming, especially for large sites. Implementing a caching mechanism could improve performance during development and testing. Currently, the extractors process all pages from scratch every time they run, which is inefficient when the content hasn't changed.

## Impact
- Slower development iterations
- Increased resource usage during testing
- Reduced performance for end users when running multiple extractions
- Unnecessary processing of unchanged content

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run any extractor on a large site
2. Run the same extractor again without changing the site content
3. Observe that the extraction takes the same amount of time as the first run

## Expected Behavior
The second run should be significantly faster as it should use cached results from the first run.

## Actual Behavior
The second run takes the same amount of time as the first run because all pages are processed from scratch.

## Screenshots/Evidence
N/A

## Suggested Solution
Create a caching system that stores extraction results to avoid redundant processing:

1. Create a `extractor-cache.js` utility in the `utils` directory
2. Implement functions for:
   - Checking if a valid cache exists
   - Reading from cache
   - Writing to cache
   - Invalidating cache
3. Modify extractors to use the cache manager
4. Add cache configuration options to the default config

Example implementation:
```javascript
const cache = new Map();

async function extractWithCache(page, url, config, cacheKey) {
  if (config.useCache && cache.has(cacheKey)) {
    return cache.get(cacheKey);
  }

  const result = await extractFromPage(page, url, config);

  if (config.useCache) {
    cache.set(cacheKey, result);
  }

  return result;
}
```
