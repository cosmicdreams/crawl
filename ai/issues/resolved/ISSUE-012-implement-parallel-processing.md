# Implement Parallel Processing for Extractors

## Description
For large sites, processing pages in parallel could significantly improve performance. Currently, pages are processed sequentially, which can be slow for sites with many pages. Implementing parallel processing would allow multiple pages to be processed simultaneously, reducing the overall extraction time.

## Impact
- Slow extraction process for large sites
- Inefficient use of system resources
- Poor user experience when processing many pages
- Increased waiting time for results

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run any extractor on a site with 20+ pages
2. Observe the sequential processing of pages
3. Note the total time taken to process all pages

## Expected Behavior
Pages should be processed in parallel, with multiple pages being analyzed simultaneously, resulting in significantly reduced total processing time.

## Actual Behavior
Pages are processed one at a time, sequentially, resulting in longer total processing time.

## Screenshots/Evidence
N/A

## Suggested Solution
Implement parallel processing for page extraction:

1. Modify the `extractXFromCrawledPages` functions to support parallel processing
2. Add concurrency configuration options
3. Implement a chunking mechanism to process pages in batches
4. Add progress reporting
5. Ensure proper resource cleanup

Example implementation:
```javascript
async function extractFromCrawledPagesParallel(customConfig = {}, logger = console) {
  const config = { ...defaultConfig, ...customConfig };
  const crawlResults = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(config.inputFile, 'utf8'));
  const pages = crawlResults.crawledPages.filter(page => page.status === 200);

  // Limit concurrency to avoid overwhelming the system
  const concurrency = config.concurrency || 5;
  const chunks = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < pages.length; i += concurrency) {
    chunks.push(pages.slice(i, i + concurrency));
  }

  const results = [];

  for (const chunk of chunks) {
    const chunkPromises = chunk.map(async (pageInfo) => {
      const browser = await chromium.launch();
      try {
        const context = await browser.newContext();
        const page = await context.newPage();
        return await extractFromPage(page, pageInfo.url, config);
      } finally {
        await browser.close();
      }
    });

    const chunkResults = await Promise.all(chunkPromises);
    results.push(...chunkResults);
  }

  return results;
}
```
