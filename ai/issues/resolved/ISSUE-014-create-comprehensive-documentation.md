# Create Comprehensive Documentation for Extractors

## Description
The extractors lack comprehensive documentation, making it difficult for new developers to understand how they work and how to use them. Creating detailed documentation would improve maintainability and onboarding. Currently, the documentation is limited to JSDoc comments in the code, which don't provide a complete picture of how the extractors work together.

## Impact
- Difficult onboarding for new developers
- Increased time spent understanding the codebase
- Higher risk of misuse or bugs when modifying extractors
- Limited knowledge sharing

## Reproduction Steps
1. Try to understand how an extractor works without looking at the code
2. Attempt to use an extractor with custom configuration
3. Note the lack of comprehensive documentation

## Expected Behavior
There should be detailed documentation explaining the purpose, functionality, API, configuration options, and output format of each extractor, along with usage examples.

## Actual Behavior
Documentation is limited to JSDoc comments in the code, with no comprehensive guide or examples.

## Screenshots/Evidence
N/A

## Suggested Solution
Create comprehensive documentation for the extractors:

1. Create a `docs` directory in the project root
2. Create a documentation file for each extractor
3. Create a general documentation file for the extraction process
4. Create diagrams showing the extraction process
5. Include code examples for common use cases

Documentation structure for each extractor:
- Purpose and overview
- API reference
- Configuration options
- Usage examples
- Output format
- Common issues and solutions

Example documentation:
```markdown
# Typography Extractor

## Overview
The Typography Extractor analyzes web pages to extract typography-related styles, including font families, sizes, weights, line heights, and letter spacing.
